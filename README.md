Reflection Note

From this project, I learned how different classes and interfaces can work together in one program.
I understood better how to use inheritance and exceptions to make the code easier to fix and understand. 
The hardest part for me was getting the classes to work correctly with each other without errors.
I think the purpose of this project was to help us learn how to organize code and handle problems in a real program.
